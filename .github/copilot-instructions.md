# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Git Commit Naming Rules

- Use concise, descriptive commit messages.
- Start with a verb in the present tense (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update", "Remove").
- Example: `Add login page UI and tests`
- You do not need to reference tickets or issues in commit messages.
- Avoid generic messages like "update" or "fix".

## Branch Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for branch names (e.g., `feature/add-checkout-page`, `bugfix/fix-login-error`).
- Prefix branches by type:
	- `feature/` for new features
	- `bugfix/` for bug fixes
	- `hotfix/` for urgent fixes
	- `chore/` for maintenance tasks
- You do not need to include ticket or issue numbers in branch names.
